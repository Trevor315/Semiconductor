    <p>Fairchild Semiconductor is a branch of the main company, ON semiconductor.  
      They create semiconductors to put in computers and other devices,
       which allow them to properly function and go at the recommended, or desired, speed.</p>

       <p>However, they didn't only make semiconductors.  They also made things such as transistors, and integrated circuits.
         Transistors are electric devices that switch, or amplify, electrical signals and power.</p>
         <p>Integrated circuits, on the other hand, have revolutionized the electronic industry, because they are small, 
         easily portable devices that hold all of the information/processing power within the computer.
           They are also less expensive than other means of the same technology.

       <p>However, Fairchild Semiconductors didn't start as the most profidable buisness, so there were times where they wern't
         doing much.   When the buisness was first started, by Shockley, there wasn't anyone who wanted to come out to 
         the west coast, where he based himself, for a possibility of a failure.  Shockley wanted to develop a new type of 
         "4-layer-diode", which would be cheaper than those currently on the market.</p>
         <p>Fortunatly, there were new engineering students fresh out of college that Shockley convinced to come onboard.  However, 
           he proved to be a good recruiter, but a bad manager, and things went downhill fast.</p>
