    <p>Fairchild Semiconductor is a branch of the main company, ON semiconductor.  
      They create semiconductors to put in computers and other devices,
       which allow them to properly function and go at the recommended, or desired, speed.</p>
       <p>However, they didn't only make semiconductors.  They also made things such as transistors, and integrated circuits.
         Transistors are electric devices that switch, or amplify, electrical signals and power.</p>
         <p>Integrated circuits, on the other hand, have revolutionized the electronic industry, because they are small, 
         easily portable devices that hold all of the information/processing power within the computer.
           They are also less expensive than other means of the same technology.
